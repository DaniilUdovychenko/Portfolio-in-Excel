# Interpreting Trends and Assigning Regional Codes
### Subtitle: 
 Analysis of Q2 2021 volume by region to map performance against expectations and confirm regional code assignments.

### Executive Summary
 The analysis involved reconciling regional data codes, calculating year-over-year (YoY) growth variances, and performing a customer retention audit to identify root causes for performance shifts.
 While overall regional operations remain functional, Q2 2021 saw a significant volume deficit of 14,000 units compared to the forecasted year-over-year growth established in Q1. This decline is not a broad market failure but is largely driven by a specific Tier 1 client churn event within the LATAM region.
 
### Business Problem:
 The primary business problem is the need for a timely and accurate assessment of the second quarter 2021 regional sales volume to inform the Board of Directors on the company's performance.
 Performance Measurement: How did volume look across the key operating regions in Q2 2021?

 Is the current regional volume performance "looking good," and are there any major red flags or underperforming divisions that require attention?

### Methodology:
1. Cleaning process
 My objective: Dataset need to be prepared for analysis and exploration.
 Dataset was checked for any duplicates and null values. Formated text-to-date and text-to-values. Figered out how many regions dataset has and what are these regions. Created new table specifically for Geo codes. So, at the end of the process, I had a clear dataset with all necessary data to the next step.
2. Data Exploration and Analysis
 Created pivot tables. Use pivot tables for quick slicing and dicing. Create pivot chart. Made some forecast, based on the first quarter year-over-year growth, that Q2 might have been year-over-year stats. In Q2 2021, we observed an aggregate decline of 14,000 units in year-over-year (YoY) growth compared to our Q1 forecast. A regional deep dive reveals that 56% of this variance is attributable to the LATAM region, which significantly underperformed against expectations.
An analysis of active client counts confirms the loss of two clients during Q2 2021. Most notably, one 'massive' client — who joined in Q3 2020 and showed strong volume in Q1 2021 — churned in Q2. This single account loss represents the primary driver behind the volume deficit in the LATAM region.

### Skills:
Excel skills  ( formulas, functions, pivot tables, pivot charts, formating, filtering)


### Results and Business Recomendation
Q2 YoY growth slowed from Q1 growth of 4% down to 2.7%, or (~ 13k) in volume primarily driven by :
- (7k) volume, or 55% of the dicline from loss of two customers in LATAM, driving overall growth for region down from 9% in Q1 to flat in Q2 YoY
same store sales slower than expected in Q2 vs Q1 YoY, comprising majority of remaining varience
- NAM client onboarding in Q2 2020 anniverseried in Q2 2021, slowing percieved growth and amplifying Q1 growth by (~ 5k) units or 1%

### Next Steps
  * Conduct an "Interview" or account review for the massive client lost in Q2 to identify if the cause was price, service, or market-related.
  * Implement a "Client Dashboard" to flag declining volume in Tier 1 accounts before they churn.
